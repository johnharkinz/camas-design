# DEC-001 — Role of the `camas-design` repository

## Decision

`camas-design` will be the source of truth for the Camas design project.

It will contain and demonstrate:

- project and design briefs
- design references
- visual explorations
- agreed design decisions
- assets
- design-system documentation
- representative Camas product screens

Once the visual direction is established, the repository will also contain a small runnable reference site for demonstrating the design system in realistic contexts.

It will **not initially be a shared production UI or component library** used directly by `camas.dev`, Shareable, Noggin or Bonce.

Each product will implement the agreed design within its own codebase.

## Rationale

The immediate goal is to establish a coherent visual identity and product design, not to solve component sharing or code reuse.

Keeping the design repository separate allows us to:

- explore freely without being constrained by existing implementations
- make design decisions before turning them into production code
- test the design across websites, web applications and compact browser extensions
- keep the design system understandable independently of any one framework or product
- avoid turning the design phase into an engineering exercise too early

A shared production component package can be considered later if the implementations reveal enough genuine duplication to justify one.

## Status

Accepted
